# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Given a list of edges, generate and print a minimum spanning tree

Reads a csv file containing a list of connected cities in the form of an adjacency list, and generates and prints a minimum spanning tree to show least amount of distance needed to connect all the cities.

The program uses the book author's unmodified DisjSets.java class, which can be found here:
