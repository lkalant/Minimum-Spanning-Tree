# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Given a list of edges, generate and print a minimum spanning tree

Reads a csv file containing a list of connected cities in the form of an adjacency list, and uses Kruskal's algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree.  The result shows the connections needed for the least total distance to connect all the cities.

The input file can also be expanded or modified, while maintaining the adjacency list format, to include other connections.

The program uses the book author's unmodified DisjSets.java class, which can be found here:
